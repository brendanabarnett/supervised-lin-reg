# Supervised Learning Linear Regression
The 'Hello, World!' of machine learning. This is a simple supervised machine learning linear regression model created using a PyTorch framework. I employed a standard stochastic gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error.

### Requirements
- Environment that supports Python
- PyTorch: Framework for building the supervised learning model
- NumPy: Simplify array operations
- Matplotlib: Plot predictions

### Model Overview
- **Model Type:** Linear Regression
- **Optimization Function:** Stochastic Gradient Descent
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error

### Usage
- This is a demo implementation, and you can run the code using the provided data
- Feel free to edit the fields provided to get a better idea of what they do

### The Goal
- The aim is to create a series of demo repositories to make machine learning more approachable through simple examples
- Future updates will involve additional documentation to further explain design decisions and important functions
